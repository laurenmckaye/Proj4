# Project 4
## Prompt
Here is the prompt for the given project: "The goal of this project is to find some data and perform a modeling task. You can use any data you want and ask any question, but you must use either a regression model or a decision tree/forest. For this project you will want to use the train test split function to split your data into a training and testing set. " 

## Execution
For my modeling task, I decided to compete in a Kagglehub competition regarding predicting makret home prices based on specific characteristics from the homes using data from Ames Iowa generated by the American Statistical Association. The competition aims to apply advanced regression teqniques such as the eXtreme Gradient Boosting package that I employed. 

The competition is judged off of the root mean squared log error, thus the closer to zero the better the prediciton. 
## Usage
This code is able to be run through Python.
